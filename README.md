# 💻 From Full-Stack Development to Applied Machine Learning

## About Me

I’m an intermediate software developer currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Ottawa**.

My background combines **software engineering**, **data analysis**, and **applied machine learning**, with a strong focus on building **practical, data-driven systems** rather than research-heavy models or infrastructure.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **data, ML, and real products** — taking messy inputs, structuring them, and turning them into usable outputs.

---

## What I Focus On

* Building **end-to-end ML workflows** (data ingestion → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation)
* Applied machine learning and analytics (not heavy cloud or infra)
* Integrating ML and AI into user-facing applications
* Working with real datasets, tradeoffs, and imperfect data
